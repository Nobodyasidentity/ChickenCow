**ChickenCow**, a resourcepack focused mainly on quality-of-life while offering some unique stuff like the IKEA blåhaj plushie as a totem  
I've tried to also keep it compatible with [Trusted Pack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/trusted-pack), I just have to hope that they don't add some music disc that I'm already using..  
some of the features are:  
- base-10 enchant levels
- base-10 potion potency
- Blåhaj of undying
- HD shield banners
- lower shield
- custom music discs
  - Teminite, BoomKitty, Waterflame & Autodidactic - Slash Inferno
  - Will Wood - BlackBoxWarrior
  - ミラクルミュージカル - Labyrinth
- different textures for banner patterns
- quieter boats
